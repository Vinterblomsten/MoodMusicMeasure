# Mood, Music and Measure
The files we have used throughout the experiment:

Experiment.py is the experiment in pyschopy

stanModel.stan is the script for the RL-Model fit

Blockorder-counter.xlsx

RScript 1 and 2 is our analysis

BillagTekster.pdf concists of the self-chosen texts we use throughout the course

We lost the document simulation.py, which we used to simulate the different values for the RL parameters, which also produces one of the plots in the report.
